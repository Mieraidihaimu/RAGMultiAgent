# Search Comparison - Status

## âœ… Files Restored and Committed

The core search comparison module has been restored with:

1. **config.py** - Configuration for all three search engines
2. **elasticsearch_engine.py** - Fuzzy keyword matching with BM25
3. **hybrid_engine.py** - Reciprocal Rank Fusion combining both approaches  
4. **requirements.txt** - All Python dependencies
5. **README.md** - Full documentation

## ðŸ“‹ Files Still Needed

To make the module fully functional, you still need:

### 1. semantic_engine.py
The vector embedding search engine. Key features:
- Sentence transformers for local (FREE) embeddings
- OpenAI embeddings support
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- Cosine similarity search

### 2. sample_data.py
Test dataset with 16 sample documents covering:
- Authentication & Security
- Account Management  
- Billing & Payments
- API & Integrations
- Technical Support
- Privacy & Compliance

Plus 8 test queries for different scenarios (typos, synonyms, etc.)

### 3. compare.py
CLI tool for running comparisons:
```bash
python compare.py "password reset"
python compare.py --benchmark
```

### 4. demo_server.py  
FastAPI web server with beautiful UI for side-by-side comparison at http://localhost:8001

### 5. Dockerfile
For running in Docker Compose with the rest of your stack

## ðŸš€ Quick Recovery

To get the missing files, I can:
1. Recreate them from scratch (takes 5-10 minutes)
2. You can write them yourself following the patterns in the existing code
3. Pull from a backup if you have one

The core search logic is already there in the 3 engine files! The missing pieces are mainly:
- The sample data for testing
- The CLI and web UI wrappers
- Docker integration

## ðŸ’¡ What You Have Now

With just the files committed, you can already:

```python
from elasticsearch_engine import ElasticsearchEngine
from config import ES_CONFIG

# Create engine
es = ElasticsearchEngine(ES_CONFIG)

# Index your own documents
docs = [{"id": "1", "title": "Test", "content": "Hello world", "category": "test", "tags": []}]
es.index_documents(docs)

# Search
results = es.search("hello")
print(results)
```

The same pattern works for the hybrid engine once you have semantic_engine.py!

Want me to create the remaining files now?

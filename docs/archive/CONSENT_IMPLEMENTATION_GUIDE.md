**Location**: `/database/migrations/004_add_consent_tracking.sql`

#### Users Table Extensions

New columns added to the `users` table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Updated Files

#### `api/auth.py`

**New Pydantic Models**:

```python
class ConsentData(BaseModel):
    """User consent information for GDPR compliance"""
    terms_accepted: bool
    terms_version: str = "1.0"
    privacy_accepted: bool
    privacy_version: str = "1.0"
    marketing: bool = False
    analytics: bool = False
    data_processing: bool = True

class UserSignup(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: str
    name: Optional[str] = None
    consent: ConsentData  # Now required!

class ConsentUpdate(BaseModel):
    """Model for updating user consent preferences"""
    marketing: Optional[bool] = None
    analytics: Optional[bool] = None

class ConsentHistoryResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for consent history"""
    id: str
    consent_type: str
    consent_given: bool
    consent_version: Optional[str] = None
    consent_timestamp: datetime
    action: str
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Navigate to the database migrations directory
cd database/migrations

# Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run the migration
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f 004_add_consent_tracking.sql
```

Or if using a migration tool:

```bash
# Add migration to your migration runner
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Update Backend Dependencies

Ensure you have all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi pydantic python-jose bcrypt asyncpg loguru
```

### Step 3: Verify Backend Changes

1. The backend changes are already in place:
   - `api/auth.py` - Updated with consent models
   - `api/auth_routes.py` - Updated with consent endpoints

2. Restart your FastAPI server:
```bash
cd api
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend Changes

1. Upload updated files to your web server:
   - `frontend/login.html` - Updated signup form
   - `frontend/consent-preferences.html` - New consent management page

2. Update navigation (if needed) to link to consent preferences page

### Step 5: Create Terms & Privacy Pages

**Important**: You need to create actual Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages. Update the links in:
- `frontend/login.html` (lines 382, 389)
- `frontend/consent-preferences.html` (if needed)

Replace `#terms` and `#privacy` with actual URLs.

### Step 6: Test the Implementation

See [Testing Guide](#testing-guide) below.

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing

#### 1. Test Signup with Consent

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/login.html`
2. Click "Sign Up" tab
3. Try to submit without checking required consents → Should show error
4. Fill in all fields and check all required consents
5. Optionally check marketing/analytics
6. Submit → Should create account and redirect

**Expected**:
- Account created successfully
- User redirected to dashboard
- Consent recorded in database

#### 2. Test Consent Status API

```bash
# Get auth token from signup response or login
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/auth/consent/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Expected**: JSON response with current consent status

#### 3. Test Consent Update

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/consent-preferences.html`
2. Toggle marketing consent on/off
3. Toggle analytics consent on/off
4. Check consent history updates

**Expected**:
- Toggles work smoothly
- Success message displayed
- History table updates immediately

#### 4. Test Consent History

curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/auth/consent/history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Expected**: Array of consent history entries

#### 5. Test Account Deletion

1. On consent preferences page, click "Withdraw All Consents & Delete Account"
2. Confirm both dialogs
3. Should show deletion message and redirect to login after 5 seconds

**Expected**:
- Account status changed to 'deleted'
- Consent history logged
- User logged out and redirected

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check user consent data
SELECT
    email,
    consent_terms_accepted,
    consent_privacy_accepted,
    consent_marketing,
    consent_analytics,
    consent_data_processing
FROM users
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Check consent history
SELECT
    consent_type,
    consent_given,
    action,
    consent_timestamp
FROM consent_history
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_UUID'
ORDER BY consent_timestamp DESC;

-- Check consent audit trail completeness
SELECT * FROM user_consent_status
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### Automated Testing (Optional)

Create test cases for:
- Signup without required consents (should fail)
- Signup with all required consents (should succeed)
- Update optional consents (should succeed)
